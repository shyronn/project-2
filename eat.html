        <h2>Stay for the food</h2>
        <p class="intro">Some of the following traditional foods are still eaten every day; others crop up mainly at special occasions such as the midwinter Porramatur feasts, though restaurants may serve them year round.</p>
        <hr> 
        <p>Just about every settlement in Iceland has a restaurant of some sort. In Reykjavík, and to a lesser extent Akureyri and the larger towns, you can get everything from traditional Icelandic fare to Mexican, Thai, Chinese, and Italian- and French-inspired dishes, and there are even a couple of vegetarian places. This is the most expensive way to dine—expect to pay upwards of 2500kr for a main dish—though keep your eyes peeled for lunchtime specials offered, or inexpensive fixed-price meals of soup, bread and stew. All-you-can-eat smorgasbords or buffets also crop up, especially around Christmas, when restaurants seem to compete with each other over the calorie contents of their spreads of cold meats and cakes.</p>

<p>In the country, pickings are far slimmer. Some hotel restaurants have fine food, though it’s more often filling than particularly memorable; prices can be as high as in any restaurant, but are generally lower. Otherwise, the only place offering cooked food might be the nearest fuel station roadhouse, which will whip up fast fodder such as pylsur (hot dogs), burgers, grills, sandwiches and pizzas – virtually Iceland’s national dish – for a few hundred krónur.</p>

<p>Found all over the country, bars, besides being somewhere to have a drink, also usually sell meals and are frequently decorated along particular themes – decked out 1950s-style, for example, or hung with fishing memorabilia. Cafés are increasingly common in even small villages, offering light meals, coffee and Icelandic cakes.</p>
